# WALLETS

Simulation dive. This Friend is the wallet. Scoop simulated $RAREFRIENDS and burn them as FriendSDK chance capsules to phase through five strata. Ash does not come back.

**Category:** Token Activity (also Economy Potential)

**Stack:** FriendSDK v0.1.4 (`@rarefriends/friendsdk/game`, wallet, owned friends, and sprites) inside a Node 22 web app. The dive is a full-screen canvas, not the FriendSDK 960×640 sandbox frame. Connect a wallet and the diver is that Generations NFT. With no wallet, the diver is original geometric art. Burns go through the SDK preview client (`buy`, `play`, `settle`, `redeem`).

## Run it

Node.js 22+.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stevereynolds2006-ship-it/wallets.git
cd wallets
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the printed URL (normally `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).

Burns stay simulated on the stand-in. Connect a wallet, pick a Friend, and dive. MetaMask sends 25 RF from the connected account to `0xb7823b2e28484382aa70952a7818712e8ac42a72` before the run starts. Beat the dive and half, 12.5 RF, is the return from that address. A failed dive keeps the 25. The page can take the stake. It cannot sign the return, because that address is a normal wallet. The wallet stays closed while you play.

## Play

- Connect wallet, under the title, reads the Friends you hold. In the MetaMask browser it prompts that wallet. Anywhere else, the same button opens the MetaMask app. Pick a Friend, then Dive. That NFT's on-chain sprite is the diver. Disconnect wallet forgets that Friend on this page. It does not spend RF.
- Start with nothing selected dives as the stand-in, strata 01, RAIN, with 22 simulated RF.
- Steer with A and D, the arrow keys, the on-screen chevrons, or by dragging. A and the left chevron turn left.
- W or up boosts. S or down brakes.
- Space, K, or BURN phases you. It does not open the wallet. The stand-in spends 1 simulated RF. While phased, hazards pass through you and nearby RF is pulled in. A connected Friend pays 25 RF before the dive. A clear run is owed 12.5 RF back.
- Reach the end of a stratum only after you have burned that stratum's quota. The seal then cracks and the next stratum starts. Five strata end at GARGANTUA.
- Three hits collapse the dive. Coins add RF to the pocket. A dry pocket refuses the next burn until you scoop more.
- Mute and reduced motion are on the menu. Escape pauses.

## Costs and rewards

**All balances, purchases, and returns are simulated.** Capsule price is 1 RF. You start with 22 RF. Expected return is 0.30 RF per capsule, so the expected sink is 0.70 RF. Chances sum to 10,000 basis points.

| Outcome | Chance | Comes back |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ash | 55% | 0 RF |
| Cinder | 25% | 0 RF |
| Echo | 15% | 1 RF |
| Drip | 5% | 3 RF |

Strata burn quotas: RAIN 6, GRID 10, WAVE 14, TESSERACT 18, GARGANTUA 24.

FriendSDK v0.1.4 settles each capsule on a preview ledger with a shadow balance so the client can buy, play, settle, and redeem. The number on screen is the 22 RF stipend plus scooped coins, not that shadow balance. Those capsules never move RF. A connected dive is separate: 25 RF goes to `0xb7823b2e28484382aa70952a7818712e8ac42a72` before play. Clearing it is owed 12.5 RF back from that address.

## Checks and known limits

`node --experimental-strip-types --test src/game/sim.test.ts` — 6 tests, all passing (Ash sink, Drip redeem, empty-wallet refusal, A turns left, seal stays shut until the quota, strata 01 cracks after the quota). The static page build (`npm run pages`) succeeds.

- A connected dive sends 25 RF to `0xb7823b2e28484382aa70952a7818712e8ac42a72` before play. A clear run is owed 12.5 RF back from that address. This page cannot send that return. A failed dive keeps the 25. The stand-in never sends RF.
- Connect reads ownership and the canonical Generations bitmap. Burns during play stay simulated.
- Without a wallet, the diver is original art.
- The stage fills the visible screen, including the MetaMask browser's fullscreen control.
- Best score and lifetime burn stay in this browser (`localStorage`).

## Credits

FriendSDK v0.1.4 from [spokesz/friendsdk](https://github.com/spokesz/friendsdk). SDK code is Apache-2.0. A connected diver uses that Friend's canonical Generations bitmap. Scenery, the stand-in, and tones are original.
